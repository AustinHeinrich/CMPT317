### Assignement 4 - Minimax Search
This assignment revolved around a board game styled off the N-Queens program. 
The object of the game was to be the last player to put a piece (a queen) on 
the board, and therefore minimize the amount of queens the other player can 
play. The project uses a variety of Minimax algorithms, some with Alpha-Beta 
Pruning, some with Depth-Cutoff. There is also a large number of tests for 
the code present. Overall, it demonstrates a fine understanding of minimax 
and testing practices.

I don't think the project works perfectly, though it was graded very well, but the 
general concepts of Minimax Search, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Depth-Cuttoff with Minimax, 
et. al. are there. As well, organization is lacking, but that was asked of us.
